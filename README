Download this, look at it, go make some tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches and enjoy them.  Then when you are done eating, use a serious colorscheme.  You could possibly set some useful commands to change the colorscheme to tomatosoup.vim around lunch and dinner time.  :)  Have fun, and happy vimming!
